# Linear-Polynomial-Regression
### Summary
##### I used a "kaggle" dataset (from Nikhil Narayan) which I split into two datasets, a training dataset and a test dataset. I used both a linear regression and polynomial regression model to predict the performance index for the test dataset.

##### I calculated the mean squared error of the transformed polynomial dataset and the mean squared error of the transformed test dataset to see how close the values were. I did this to address possible overfitting.

##### I understand that artificial neural networks can predict data efficiently, so I might also implement that in the future.

### Variables:
##### Hours Studied: The total number of hours spent studying by each student.
##### Previous Scores: The scores obtained by students in previous tests.
##### Extracurricular Activities: Whether the student participates in extracurricular activities (Yes-1 or No-0).
##### Sleep Hours: The average number of hours of sleep the student had per day.
##### Sample Question Papers Practiced: The number of sample question papers the student practiced.
#### Target Variable:

##### Performance Index: A measure of the overall performance of each student. The performance index represents the student's academic performance and has been rounded to the nearest integer. The index ranges from 10 to 100, with higher values indicating better performance.
